# Welcome, human (probably)

You’ve entered **0xm0t0k0’s Cryptography & CS Lab**, where I test algorithms, break ciphers, and occasionally write obscure theoretical art papers about the **art** of solving puzzles in any shape or form.

Future posts will dive into:
- Fine Arts & Hacking
- Solving CryptoHacks Challenges
- Understanding Cryptography Deeply
- Implementing DSA in multiple languages
- Anything else that sparks my interest :3

## About Me

I'm **0xm0t0k0, real name: 9366b1d5923333c2671f1688f9a9170549061196a0aab291** (go solve this if you haven't already owo).
Ever since I was young my main interest was being interested, aka being curious. I love learning about new things,
connecting dots and finding out stuff. Naturally I gravitated towards 3 things: Computers, Theory & Art. What may come out of 
this synthesis? Who cares, right? 

But- Here's the thing; I can't choose what I like most, so I try to use all of these things together and create new stuff.
Also, I have found that having a nice theoretical foundation informs your analytical problem-solving skills as well. So i guess yay :3 

In this blog you'll find stuff that could very well inform a computer nerd *like myself* as much as the interested general reader. If you follow through what I'm saying I guarantee you will come out having earned sth from this mediated interaction between our brains. (Note: I have been told I cause headaches to people with the constant rumbling about my interests so maybe all you earn is a headache >.<)

So computers as you may have heard is nothing more than abstractions on abstractions on abstractions. That is also what art is, at least for me. A computer is composed of something called **logic gates** and that really makes me smile. Why? Because any function that is computable is logically expressible (or more formally can be expressed through logical composition). That is known also as the Church-Turing thesis. Why does it make me smile? Because it comforts my human brain that finally there are patterns I can actually predict and a formal system where (admittedly) many things could go wrong, but if you follow the logic you can debug it, you can reverse engineer it, you could "hack" it.

Wasn't it the same case with art and actual visual abstraction in the 20th century modern art? Finding the primitives of art? Dissecting it into little fundamental pieces, whether they are geometrical (e.g Kandinsky), colour-related(a Mondrian or a Rothko comes in mind) or even the first principles of what makes a work of art a "work of art" (could look into Malevich). Everywhere we see an infinite resuscitation of the same human needs, a need to understand their world and make sense of it.

What we encounter with art is a soft problem, a problem which its' solutions are typically ambiguous and subjective relying mostly on perceptions and interpretations of the participants involved. What's more someone could propose that actually art is not a problem at all. It is not something to be solved, just a means of expression. That too though is a problem because if it's fundamentally just a means of expression, does this assumption, if taken to be true, also imply that there are no rules of expression? Is it only cultural bias when someone likes something? Is it only a matter of sociological factors in the deciding equation of taste or also an innate ability of humans to appreciate things. Why do we appreciate a well-formulated theorem? And why do I feel more of an artist when I'm reading a disassembly than when I'm painting? I dare not answer these questions but I dare say that even asking these questions could pose a challenge in today's decaying view of art and the institutions that house it. There was a distinction between art and decoration, that I find that might be lost today but I'm definitely not a romantic to some lost old golden time. As I said, I feel more of an artist while analysing code TwT

 Now for the *formal* stuff (skip if bored):

-Graduating in June 2026 with a **Diploma (MAi & BFA) in Fine and Applied Arts** from UoWM

-Will attend **BSc on Computer Science** in AuTH

-Couple of **CyberSec certificates** on my LinkedIn

-Mostly interested in **Security Research**

-My interests as of the time being include but not limited to: **Applied Cryptography, Malware Research, Reverse Engineering,** and some good ol' **Binary Exploitation**. TL;DR low-level security stuff that are in my mind like puzzles.

-I do **CTFs** regularly and will be posting about them on this very blog!

Puzzles are so interesting to me and I find that the aforementioned interests are mostly puzzles but in these warm fuzzy *for my brain* machines that everything makes sense.

If you are interested in my theoretical and artistic stuff I have a separate page *again* in this very same blog where you dear reader could find my "artworks" as well as my theoretical works. Some are in Greek though (thank god for LLMs you now can translate them with expert level accuracy with the right prompts).

That's all folks. *que the end music*
